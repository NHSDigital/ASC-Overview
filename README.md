**Please do not use the VS Code Git Tab to commit as this will no longer work.**

_However, you can use it for adding files to be committed._

# Running the code

Please check that the settings, including the path to the input files, are correct in `ascs/params.py`.

You can then create the publication (from the base directory) using

```
python -m asc_overview.create_publication
```

You can run the tests on the repository using (from the base directory)

```
pytest

# Package structure

The main steps of the code are documented in `ascs_overview/create_publication.py`

# Important things to know

## Running for next year

Create a new params file in the `params_json` folder by duplicating the previous year's json file. Update the parameters accordingly. Be wary of the cell references as these may need to be changed if the data source publications change. You will also need to output cell references so that the timeseries data is outputted in the correct place. The template excel file may also need to be changed to reflect the updates of the previous year.
